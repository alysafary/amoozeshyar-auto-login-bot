About the Bot:
This bot is designed using the Selenium package to automatically log in to the user panel of the "Amoozeshyar educational" website. To log in to the Amoozeshyar user panel, in the first step, the username and password are entered, followed by the captcha image code. In the second step, by entering the verification code that is sent in the igap messaging app, you can log in to the website. This bot performs all these steps automatically.

How to Use:
To use the bot, after installing the required packages that are included in the requirements file, by entering the personal username and password in the login file then adding chrome browser to the system path and running the main file, the bot starts working. 

Details:
1. The bot uses an OCR engine with a very powerful API site to solve the captcha image.
2. To facilitate obtaining the verification code that is sent in the igap system, the bot uses the Remote Debugger Address, which needs to be logged into the igap web messenger for the first time on port 9222 with the phone number associated with the account so that the bot can extract the code from the same port and account without the need for re-logging in.
